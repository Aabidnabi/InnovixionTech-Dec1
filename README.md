# Personal Website Project

## Overview

Welcome to my personal website project! This simple website serves as an introduction to who I am, featuring my name, a brief bio, contact information, and links to my social media profiles. This project is an excellent way for me to establish an online presence and practice HTML and CSS skills.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the content of the website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the HTML content.
- `assests/`: A directory to store any images used on the website.

## Usage

To view the website locally or make further modifications, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aabidnabi/InnovixionTech-Dec1.git
    cd InnovixionTech-Dec1
    ```

2. **Open in a Browser:**
    - Double-click on `index.html` or open it with your preferred web browser to view the website.

3. **Modify Content:**
    - Open `index.html` in a text editor of your choice (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text).
    - Update the content within the HTML tags to reflect your personal information.

4. **Styling (Optional):**
    - If you want to customize the appearance, you can modify styles in the `style.css` file.

5. **Preview Changes:**
    - Refresh the browser to see your changes.

6. **Commit and Push:**
    - If you're satisfied with your changes, commit and push them to your GitHub repository.
